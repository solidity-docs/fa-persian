Solidity Brand Guide

This brand guide features information on Solidity's brand policy and
logo usage guidelines.

The Solidity Brand
==================

The Solidity programming language is an open-source, community project
governed by a core team. The core team is sponsored by the `Ethereum
Foundation <https://ethereum.foundation/>`_.

This document aims to provide information about how to best use the
Solidity brand name and logo.

We encourage you to read this document carefully before using the
brand name or the logo. Your cooperation is highly appreciated!

Solidity Brand Name
===================

"Solidity" should be used to refer to the Solidity programming language
solely.

Please do not use "Solidity":

- To refer to any other programming language.

- In a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated
  modules, tools, documentation, or other resources with the Solidity
  programming language.

- In ways that confuse the community as to whether the Solidity
  programming language is open-source and free to use.

Solidity Logo License
=====================
